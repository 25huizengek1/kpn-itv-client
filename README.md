# KPN iTV Client

An Android TV application written with Compose for TV that allows you to watch live KPN television
on your TV. The difference with the existing iTV client on the Play Store is that you don't have to
be at home to watch live. This is not in any way illegal, as it reproduces the behavior of the
mobile app, which DOES work on the go.

## Development status

The codebase of this app is very new and I am aware of some bugs that may arise when used on a
Google TV, paired with the Google Home companion app. I am also aware that there are some UI
inconsistencies. I'm planning to fix this, but other projects may take priority over this one, so if
you have an issue that you want to have fixed, please let me know
by [opening an issue](https://github.com/25huizengek1/kpn-itv-client/issues/new/choose).
